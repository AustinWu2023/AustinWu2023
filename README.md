# 👋 Hi, I'm Austin

I'm a backend engineer mainly working with **C# / .NET 8**.

I spend most of my time dealing with complex business logic, system performance, and backend architecture. I really enjoy taking messy systems apart and putting them back together into something that's **clean, maintainable, and stable**.

Recently, I've been focusing on **MES (Manufacturing Execution System)** development. The system is built with a **microservices architecture**, which means a lot of real-world challenges around manufacturing workflows, real-time device data, and system integration. Because of that, I care a lot about **stability, scalability, and long-term maintainability**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Application
- **C# / .NET 8**

### Data Layer
- **Relational DB (Primary)**: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL  
- **In-memory Cache**: Redis  
- **Time-series Storage**: InfluxDB  

### Communication
- **MQTT** – real-time device & machine communication

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Docker** – containerized services
- **Kubernetes** – microservices orchestration


I enjoy learning new technologies, but I care more about whether they can be used reliably in production.

My focus is on building and refining backend systems for MES and industrial environments,
where stability, predictability, and operational clarity matter more than hype.

I’m passionate about backend engineering, system architecture, and real-time industrial systems.
