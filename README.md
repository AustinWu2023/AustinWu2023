# 👋 Hi, I'm Austin

I'm a backend engineer mainly working with **C# / .NET 8**.

I spend most of my time dealing with complex business logic, system performance, and backend architecture. I really enjoy taking messy systems apart and putting them back together into something that's **clean, maintainable, and stable**.

Recently, I've been focusing on **MES (Manufacturing Execution System)** development. The system is built with a **microservices architecture**, which means a lot of real-world challenges around manufacturing workflows, real-time device data, and system integration. Because of that, I care a lot about **stability, scalability, and long-term maintainability**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C# / .NET 8**
- **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**
- **MQTT** (real-time device communication)
- **InfluxDB** (time-series data)
- **Docker** (containerization)
- **Kubernetes** (microservices orchestration)

I like learning new technologies, but I care even more about actually using them in production.  
Rather than chasing trends, I enjoy steadily refining systems until they’re reliable, predictable, and easy to operate.

If you're into backend engineering, system architecture, or working on **MES / industrial systems**, feel free to connect 🤝
